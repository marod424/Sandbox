        <h1>CSS3 Parallax Cover Section</h1>
        <p>This is a cool vertical parallax scrolling effect that can be created in pure CSS.</p>
        <p>Note that the purpose of this pen is to act as a learning exercise, demonstrating the effects of CSS3 properties such as 3D transforms, SVG backgrounds, viewport units and so on.</p>
        <p>At the moment mobile compatibility with this technique is a little scratchy and it works best in landscape orientation, so it's not ideal for production use.</p>

        <p>The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us on the mother’s side.  About three years ago, Mr. Gulliver growing weary of the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff, made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark, in Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet in good esteem among his neighbours.</p>
        <p> Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at Banbury in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.</p>
        <p> Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit.  I have carefully perused them three times.  The style is very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the author, after the manner of travellers, is a little too circumstantial.  There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbours at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing, to say, it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoken it.</p>
