    <p>My father had a small estate in <a href="#">Nottinghamshire</a>: I was the third of five sons. He sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years old, where I resided three years, and applied myself close to my studies; but the charge of <a href="#" class="fade-in-bg">maintaining</a> me, although I had a very scanty allowance, being <a href="#" class="fade-in-bg">too great</a> for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprentice to Mr. James Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom I continued four years. </p>
    <p>My father now and then sending me small sums of money, I laid them out in learning navigation, and <a href="#" data-linktext="other parts" class="slide-from-left">other parts</a> of the mathematics, useful to those who intend to travel, as I always believed it would be, some time or other, <a href="#" data-linktext="my fortune" class="slide-from-right">my fortune</a> to do. When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my father: where, by the assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other relations, I got forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to maintain me at Leyden: there I studied physic two years and seven months, knowing it would be useful in long voyages.</p>
    <p>Soon after my return <a href="#" data-linktext="from Leyden" class="slide-from-top">from Leyden</a>, I was recommended by my good master, Mr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham Pannel, commander; with whom I continued three years and a half, making a voyage or two into the Levant, <a href="#" data-linktext="and some other" class="slide-from-bottom">and some other</a> parts. When I came back I resolved to settle in London; to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouraged me, and by him I was recommended to several patients. I took part of a small house in the Old Jewry; and being advised to alter my condition, I married Mrs. Mary Burton, second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton, hosier, in Newgate-street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for a portion.</p>
    <p>But my good master Bates dying in <a href="#" class="fade-in-underline">two years</a> after, and I having few friends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer me to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren. Having <a href="#" class="underline-from-left">therefore consulted</a> with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I determined to go again to sea. I was surgeon successively in two ships, and made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West Indies, by which I <a href="#" class="underline-from-right">got some addition</a> to my fortune. My hours of <a href="#" class="underline-from-center">leisure I spent</a> in reading the best authors, ancient and modern, being always provided with a good number of books; and when I was ashore, in observing the manners and dispositions of the people, as well as learning their language; wherein I had a great facility, by the strength of my memory.</p>
